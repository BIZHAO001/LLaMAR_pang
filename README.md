A modular vision language model (VLM)-based framework for long-horizon planning for multi-agent robots with partial observability. This is an official implementation of the model described in:

"[Long-Horizon Planning for Multi-Agent Robots in Partially Observable Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10031)",

Please let us know if anything here is not working as expected, and feel free to create [new issues](https://github.com/nsidn98/LLaMAR/issues) with any questions. Note that we are working to improve the codebase to make it more accessible and easy to use.

## Abstract:

The ability of Language Models (LMs) to understand natural language makes them a powerful tool for parsing human instructions into task plans for autonomous robots. Unlike traditional planning methods that rely on domain-specific knowledge and handcrafted rules, LMs generalize from diverse data and adapt to various tasks with minimal tuning, acting as a compressed knowledge base. However, LMs in their standard form face challenges with long-horizon tasks, particularly in partially observable multi-agent settings. We propose an LM-based Long-Horizon Planner for Multi-Agent Robotics (LLaMAR), a cognitive architecture for planning that achieves state-of-the-art results in long-horizon tasks within partially observable environments. LLaMAR employs a plan-act-correct-verify framework, allowing self-correction from action execution feedback without relying on oracles or simulators. Additionally, we present MAP-THOR, a comprehensive test suite encompassing household tasks of varying complexity within the AI2-THOR environment. Experiments show that LLaMAR achieves a 30% higher success rate than other state-of-the-art LM-based multi-agent planners in MAP-THOR and Search & Rescue tasks.

**Overview of LLaMAR**: LLaMAR splits the planning process into 4 sub-modules.

- Planner Module - Breaks down high-level language instructions into structured subtasks for execution.
- Actor Module - Selects high-level actions for each agent based on observations and memory.
- Corrector Module - Identifies failures in execution and suggests corrective actions to improve task completion.
- Verifier Module - Confirms subtask completion and updates progress, reducing reliance on external validation.

This iterative Plan-Act-Correct-Verify loop helps with long-horizon multi-agent planning in partially observable environments.

## Usage:

Save your OpenAI API Key in a JSON file named `openai_key.json` with the following format:

```json
{ "my_openai_api_key": "<your_api_key>" }
```

Then execute the python file:

- For MAP-THOR

```bash
python AI2Thor/baselines/llamar/llamar.py --task=0 --floorplan=0
```

This should run an episode on the `task=0` (Put the bread, lettuce and tomato in the fridge) on `floorplan=0` (FloorPlan1)

You can refer to `configs/config_type1.json` for the mapping on tasks and floorplans.

OR

- For Search & Rescue

```bash
python SAR/baselines/llamar.py --scene=1 --name='llamar_SAR' --agents=2 --seed=0
```

This should run an episode in a scene with one fire with 2 initially lighted cells, the other fire has 1 initially lighted location. You can refer `SAR/Scenes` for more description on the scenes.

Note: The experiments in the paper were obtained with `gpt-4-vision-preview` which has been [deprecated](https://platform.openai.com/docs/deprecations). OpenAI [suggests](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision?lang=node) using `gpt-4o-mini`. Some of the numbers from the paper might not match.

Warning: Running all the experiments from the paper cost us tokens worth around $3000 (due to the pricing structure of GPT-4 at the time of the experiments).
