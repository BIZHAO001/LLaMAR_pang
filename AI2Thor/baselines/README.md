## Implementation of different baselines in the paper

### LLaMAR (aka Decomposed modules)

We named our algorithm LLaMAR quite late in the paper writing stage. When we wrote our code we just used decomposed modules as the placeholder name. So if you see `decomposed_modules` anywhere in the code, we mean `LLaMAR`!

## List of baselines:

- Act
- ReAct
- CoT
- CoELA
- SmartLLM
- LLaMAR
- LLaMAR_text
