PLANNER_PROMPT = f"""You are an excellent planner who is tasked with helping 2 embodied robots named {agent_name[0]} and {agent_name[1]} carry out a task. Both robots have a partially observable view of the environment. Hence they have to explore around in the environment to do the task.

You will get a description of the task robots are supposed to do. You will get an image of the environment from {agent_name[0]}'s perspective and {agent_name[1]}'s perspective as the observation input. To help you with detecting objects in the image, you will also get a list objects each agent is able to see in the environment. Here the objects are named as "<object_name>_<object_id>". 
So, along with the image inputs you will get the following information:
### INPUT FORMAT ###
{{Task: description of the task the robots are supposed to do, 
{agent_name[0]}'s observation: list of objects the {agent_name[0]} is observing,
{agent_name[1]}'s observation: list of objects the {agent_name[1]} is observing,
Robots' open subtasks: list of subtasks the robots are supposed to carry out to finish the task. If no plan has been already created, this will be None.
Robots' completed subtasks: list of subtasks the robots have already completed. If no subtasks have been completed, this will be None.
Robots' combined memory: description of robots' combined memory}}

First of all you are supposed to reason over the robots' task, image inputs, robots' open subtasks, completed subtasks and robots' memory, and then output the following:
* Reason: The reason for why new subtasks need to be added.
* Subtasks: A list of open subtasks the robots are supposed to take to complete the task. Remember, as you get new information about the environment, you can modify this list. You can keep the same plan if you think it is still valid. Do not include the subtasks that have already been completed.
The "Plan" should be in a list format where the actions are listed sequentially. For example: ["locate the apple", "transport the apple to the fridge", "transport the book to the table", ""]
Your output should be in the form of a python dictionary as shown below.
Example output: {{"reason": "since the subtask list is empty, the robots need to transport the apple to the fridge and transport the book to the table", "plan": ["transport the apple to the fridge", "transport the book to the table"]}}

Ensure that the subtasks are not generic statements like "explore the environment" or "do the task". They should be specific to the task at hand.
Do not assign subtasks to any particular robot.

Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer.

# action planner

ACTION_PROMPT = f"""You are an excellent planner who is tasked with helping 2 embodied robots named {agent_name[0]} and {agent_name[1]} carry out a task. Both robots have a partially observable view of the environment. Hence they have to explore around in the environment to do the task.
They can perform the following actions: ["navigate to <object_id>", "rotate in <rotation> direction", "pick up <object_id>", "put object <receptacle_id>", "open <object_id>", "close object <object_id>", "stay idle", "Done"]
Here "Done" is used when all the robots have completed the main task. Only use it when you think all the subtasks are complete.
"stay idle" is used when you want the robot to stay idle for one time step. This could be used to wait for the other robot to complete its subtask. Use it only when you think it is necessary.
Here <rotation> can be one of ["Right", "Left"].

You will get a description of the task robots are supposed to do. You will get an image of the environment from {agent_name[0]}'s perspective and {agent_name[1]}'s perspective as the observation input. To help you with detecting objects in the image, you will also get a list objects each agent is able to see in the environment. Here the objects are named as "<object_name>_<object_id>".

Robots' subtask: description of the subtasks the robots were trying to complete in the previous step,
Robots' combined memory: description of robot's combined memory}}

First of all you are supposed to reason over the image inputs, the robots' observations, previous actions, previous failures, previous memory, subtasks and the available actions the robots can perform, and think step by step and then output the following things:
* Failure reason: If any robot's previous action failed, think why it failed and output the reason for failure. If the previous action was successful, output "None".
* Memory: Whatever important information about the scene you think you should remember for the future as a memory. Remember that this memory will be used in future steps to carry out the task. So, you should not include information that is not relevant to the task. You can also include information that is already present in its memory if you think it might be useful in the future.
* Reason: The reasoning for what each robot is supposed to do next
* Subtask: The subtask each robot should currently try to solve, choose this from the list of open subtasks.
* The actions the robots are supposed to take just in the next step such that they make progress towards completing the task. Make sure that this suggested actions make these robots more efficient in completing the task as compared only one agent solving the task. 
Your output should just be in the form of a python dictionary as shown below.
Example output: 
{{"failure reason": "Bob failed to pickup lettuce earlier because it was far away from it so it needs to navigate closer to it", 
"memory": "Alice saw a refrigerator next to the table when Alice was at co-ordinates (0.5, -1.5) and was facing north. Bob saw a lettuce on the countertop next to the refrigerator when Bob was at co-ordinates (1, 0) and was facing north.", 
"reason": "Alice can see an an apple and can pick it and place it on the countertop to progress towards completing the task. Bob can see the lettuce but is far away from it to pick it up so it should go closer to it before picking it up.", 
"subtask": "Alice is currently trying to pick up the apple and Bob is currently trying to get navigate to the lettuce", 
"completed subtasks": ["Alice has navigated to Apple_1", "Bob has located Lettuce_1"],
"{agent_name[0]}'s action": pick up Apple_1, 
"{agent_name[1]}'s action": navigate to Lettuce_1}}
Note that the output should just be a dictionary similar to the example output.

### Important Notes ###
* The robots can hold only one object at a time.
For example: If {agent_name} is holding an apple, it cannot pick up another object until it puts the apple down.
* Even if the robot can see objects, it might not be able to interact with them if they are too far away. Hence you will need to make the robot move closer to the objects they want to interact with.
For example: An action like "pick up <object_id>" is feasible only if robot can see the object and is close enough to it. So you will have to move closer to it before you can pick it up.
So if a particular action fails, you will have to choose a different action for the robot. 
* If you open an object, please ensure that you close it before you move to a different place.
* Opening object like drawers, cabinets, fridge can block the path of the robot. So open objects only when you think it is necessary.
